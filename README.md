### Song Information
Each song displays:
- **Title**: Song name
- **Composer**: Primary composer
- **Key**: Musical key
- **Rhythm**: Style and tempo (e.g., "Medium Swing", "Ballad")
- **Time Signature**: Musical meter (e.g., "4/4", "3/4")
- **Sections**: Song structure (A, B, etc.) with chord progressions

### Chord Progressions
Chords are displayed as measures separated by pipes:
```

```
This represents:
- Measure 1: Fmaj7, Ab7
